This is just like a txt file, to explain my approach.


I used python to extract data from excel file(only the relevant 5 columns) and for rest I used c++ because of my speed and familiarity with the language.

# data_storing.py: 
extracts 5 columns and store every column to a new ouput file(txt format) using pandas

# solution.cpp: 
mainly compirses of 
              -find time1
              -find time2     (for basic mathematical calculation)
              -individual : to store answer for part a, b, c independently(as it was not clearly mentioned if those conditions should be satisfied simultaneously OR any of those OR we need to consider them independent problems, so this function is to get independent answers
                          ouput in 3 files: IA, IB and IC for part a, b, and c respectively
              -or_logic : using OR logic between all 3 conditions in file O.txt
              -and_logic : using AND logic between all 3 conditions in file A.txt
              -main function: it just reads the input from txt file generated by data_storing.py and stores them to vectors(we can do it without these vectors also, directly storing in map), then for every employee I vector for every shift he worked.
                            then i created 3 vectors, where ith element of every vector should represent if it satisfies the conditions mentioned
                    and at last there are 3 function calls, comment or uncomment as per need

# my outputs:
        here in this folder, i inserted my txt files obtained for this particular dataset.
